# ePortfolio - PgDip in Artificial Intelligence (University of Essex)
## Guilherme Pessoa-Amorim

Hi! Welcome to my eportfolio. 

This repository will contain all the work produced as part of my learning within the Postgraduate Diploma (PgDip) in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Essex.

The repository will be split into Coding (where I will add scripts in Python and R) and Assignments (where I will add all my written assignments).

Questions about any of this content can be sent to guilhermepessoaamorim@gmail.com

Cheers,
Guilherme
